# triangular arbitrage function

# this is my first upload to github
# a cool function which calculates the most profitable triangular arbitrage trades for 14 different currencies
# It's still very basic, in the future I will add higher frequency data, trade costs, and time delays for order fulfillment
# I also will backtest the function for different time periods
