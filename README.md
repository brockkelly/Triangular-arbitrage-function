# triangular arbitrage function

This is my first upload to github.
A cool function which calculates the most profitable triangular arbitrage trades for 14 different currencies.
It's still very basic, in the future I will add higher frequency data, trade costs, and time delays for order fulfillment.
I also will backtest the function for different time periods.
